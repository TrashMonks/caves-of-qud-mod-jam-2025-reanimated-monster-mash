Them apples took to the mud. Will be a good season.

One of the pigs is gone.

The snappers are feisty. Had to drop one before they cleared off the range.

Still no sign of the pig.</page>

Another one gone. Dog don't seem bothered. 

Odd tracks in the mud. Sleeping with the pigs tonight.

Another one gone. Woke up in the night. Two slugs gone from my rifle. What happened?

Heat is boiling my brain. Watched the herd the whole time. One gone. Can't remember how.

There's blood in the barn.</page>
