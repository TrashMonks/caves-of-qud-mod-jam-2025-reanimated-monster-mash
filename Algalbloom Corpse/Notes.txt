It moves very slowly until prey moves nearby, when it uses a burst of speed to take down the prey and consume it, adding to the rotting mass

It photosynthesizes and lives in a nutrient-rich environment already, so it's reason for hunting is unknown. Perhaps it evolved in different circumstances yet still retains it's predatory nature? Or perhaps such a being arose out of malice towards the more traditionally alive

NEED:
-tile
-description
-drop table
-thing telling it where to spawn

-add special effects on weapon (OPTIONAL)
