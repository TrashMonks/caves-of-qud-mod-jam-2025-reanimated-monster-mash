  "Description": "[quote]Before you stood a bare, new life. History’s fuzzy wave has washed away the amniotic waters of creation, unnamed. Yet, as the Beetle Moon nears its zenith, you feel a familiar force calling out to you from the Zero Hour. As its puppet-strings wrap around your wrists, you wonder: Who has the right to name another a monster?[/quote]\n\nCompilation mod pack for the [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-4]Caves of Qud Mod Jam: reanimated Monster Mash[/url], which ran at the start of November 2025. See all the entries [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-4/entries]here[/url]!\n\nA gigantic engraved thanks with suspensors to all who participated! \n— The mod jam organizers\n\nWhile playing, use the in-game wish menu for easy access to the pack's contents (Debug > Wish Menu, bound to shift-W by default) or by wishing 'reanimatedmonstermashwishmenu' (this can be bound to its own key under Debug > reanimated Monster Mash-Up Wish Menu).\n\n[b]A note on balance:[/b] using all of these mods will likely result an extremely chaotic Caves of Qud run.\n\nThis version of the pack is for the 1.0.4 release (build 210.X) of Caves of Qud.\n\n[b]Warning:[/b] Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.\n\n[url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-4]Mod jam page (itch)[/url] | [url=https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-4/entries]Mod jam entries (itch)[/url] | [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3605340943]Submissions collection (Steam)[/url] | [url=https://github.com/TrashMonks/caves-of-qud-mod-jam-2025-reanimated-monster-mash]Source Code (GitHub)[/url]\n\n[quote]You imbued a hideous specimen with life, again.
